## Reorder Log Files
You have an array of logs.  Each log is a space delimited string of words.
For each log, the first word in each log is an alphanumeric identifier.  Then, either:
Each word after the identifier will consist only of lowercase letters, or;
Each word after the identifier will consist only of digits.
We will call these two varieties of logs letter-logs and digit-logs.  It is guaranteed that each log has at least one word after its identifier.
Reorder the logs so that all of the letter-logs come before any digit-log.  The letter-logs are ordered lexicographically ignoring identifier, with the identifier used in case of ties.  The digit-logs should be put in their original order.
Return the final order of the logs.

Example 1:

Input: ["a1 9 2 3 1","g1 act car","zo4 4 7","ab1 off key dog","a8 act zoo"]
Output: ["g1 act car","a8 act zoo","ab1 off key dog","a1 9 2 3 1","zo4 4 7"]

Note:

0 <= logs.length <= 100
3 <= logs[i].length <= 100
logs[i] is guaranteed to have an identifier, and a word after the identifier.

## Minimum Falling Path Sum
Given a square array of integers A, we want the minimum sum of a falling path through A.

A falling path starts at any element in the first row, and chooses one element from each row.  The next row's choice must be in a column that is different from the previous row's column by at most one.

Example 1:

Input: [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
Output: 12
Explanation: 
The possible falling paths are:
[1,4,7], [1,4,8], [1,5,7], [1,5,8], [1,5,9]
[2,4,7], [2,4,8], [2,5,7], [2,5,8], [2,5,9], [2,6,8], [2,6,9]
[3,5,7], [3,5,8], [3,5,9], [3,6,8], [3,6,9]
The falling path with the smallest sum is [1,4,7], so the answer is 12.

Note:

1 <= A.length == A[0].length <= 100
-100 <= A[i][j] <= 100

## Replace Words
In English, we have a concept called root, which can be followed by some other words to form another longer word - let's call this word successor. For example, the root an, followed by other, which can form another word another.

Now, given a dictionary consisting of many roots and a sentence. You need to replace all the successor in the sentence with the root forming it. If a successor has many roots can form it, replace it with the root with the shortest length.

You need to output the sentence after the replacement.

Example 1:
Input: dict = ["cat", "bat", "rat"]
sentence = "the cattle was rattled by the battery"
Output: "the cat was rat by the bat"
Note:
The input will only have lower-case letters.
1 <= dict words number <= 1000
1 <= sentence words number <= 1000
1 <= root length <= 100
1 <= sentence words length <= 1000

## Walking Robot Simulation
A robot on an infinite grid starts at point (0, 0) and faces north.  The robot can receive one of three possible types of commands:

-2: turn left 90 degrees
-1: turn right 90 degrees
1 <= x <= 9: move forward x units
Some of the grid squares are obstacles. 

The i-th obstacle is at grid point (obstacles[i][0], obstacles[i][1])

If the robot would try to move onto them, the robot stays on the previous grid square instead (but still continues following the rest of the route.)

Return the square of the maximum Euclidean distance that the robot will be from the origin.

Example 1:

Input: commands = [4,-1,3], obstacles = []
Output: 25
Explanation: robot will go to (3, 4)
Example 2:

Input: commands = [4,-1,4,-2,4], obstacles = [[2,4]]
Output: 65
Explanation: robot will be stuck at (1, 4) before turning left and going to (1, 8)

Note:
0 <= commands.length <= 10000
0 <= obstacles.length <= 10000
-30000 <= obstacle[i][0] <= 30000
-30000 <= obstacle[i][1] <= 30000
The answer is guaranteed to be less than 2 ^ 31.

## Custom Sort String
S and T are strings composed of lowercase letters. In S, no letter occurs more than once.

S was sorted in some custom order previously. We want to permute the characters of T so that they match the order that S was sorted. More specifically, if x occurs before y in S, then x should occur before y in the returned string.

Return any permutation of T (as a string) that satisfies this property.

Example :
Input: 
S = "cba"
T = "abcd"
Output: "cbad"
Explanation: 
"a", "b", "c" appear in S, so the order of "a", "b", "c" should be "c", "b", and "a". 
Since "d" does not appear in S, it can be at any position in T. "dcba", "cdba", "cbda" are also valid outputs.
 
Note:
S has length at most 26, and no character is repeated in S.
T has length at most 200.
S and T consist of lowercase letters only.


## Robot Return to Origin
There is a robot starting at position (0, 0), the origin, on a 2D plane. Given a sequence of its moves, judge if this robot ends up at (0, 0) after it completes its moves.

The move sequence is represented by a string, and the character moves[i] represents its ith move. Valid moves are R (right), L (left), U (up), and D (down). If the robot returns to the origin after it finishes all of its moves, return true. Otherwise, return false.

Note: The way that the robot is "facing" is irrelevant. "R" will always make the robot move to the right once, "L" will always make it move left, etc. Also, assume that the magnitude of the robot's movement is the same for each move.

Example 1:

Input: "UD"
Output: true 
Explanation: The robot moves up once, and then down once. All moves have the same magnitude, so it ended up at the origin where it started. Therefore, we return true.
 

Example 2:

Input: "LL"
Output: false
Explanation: The robot moves left twice. It ends up two "moves" to the left of the origin. We return false because it is not at the origin at the end of its moves.

## Unique Email Addresses
Every email consists of a local name and a domain name, separated by the @ sign.

For example, in alice@leetcode.com, alice is the local name, and leetcode.com is the domain name.

Besides lowercase letters, these emails may contain '.'s or '+'s.

If you add periods ('.') between some characters in the local name part of an email address, mail sent there will be forwarded to the same address without dots in the local name.  For example, "alice.z@leetcode.com" and "alicez@leetcode.com" forward to the same email address.  (Note that this rule does not apply for domain names.)

If you add a plus ('+') in the local name, everything after the first plus sign will be ignored. This allows certain emails to be filtered, for example m.y+name@email.com will be forwarded to my@email.com.  (Again, this rule does not apply for domain names.)

It is possible to use both of these rules at the same time.

Given a list of emails, we send one email to each address in the list.  How many different addresses actually receive mails? 

Example 1:

Input: ["test.email+alex@leetcode.com","test.e.mail+bob.cathy@leetcode.com","testemail+david@lee.tcode.com"]
Output: 2
Explanation: "testemail@leetcode.com" and "testemail@lee.tcode.com" actually receive mails
 
Note:

1 <= emails[i].length <= 100
1 <= emails.length <= 100
Each emails[i] contains exactly one '@' character.


## Group Anagrams
Given an array of strings, group anagrams together.

Example:

Input: ["eat", "tea", "tan", "ate", "nat", "bat"],
Output:
[
  ["ate","eat","tea"],
  ["nat","tan"],
  ["bat"]
]
Note:

All inputs will be in lowercase.
The order of your output does not matter.

## Frog Jump
A frog is crossing a river. The river is divided into x units and at each unit there may or may not exist a stone. The frog can jump on a stone, but it must not jump into the water.

Given a list of stones' positions (in units) in sorted ascending order, determine if the frog is able to cross the river by landing on the last stone. Initially, the frog is on the first stone and assume the first jump must be 1 unit.

If the frog's last jump was k units, then its next jump must be either k - 1, k, or k + 1 units. Note that the frog can only jump in the forward direction.

Note:

The number of stones is ≥ 2 and is < 1,100.
Each stone's position will be a non-negative integer < 231.
The first stone's position is always 0.
Example 1:

[0,1,3,5,6,8,12,17]

There are a total of 8 stones.
The first stone at the 0th unit, second stone at the 1st unit,
third stone at the 3rd unit, and so on...
The last stone at the 17th unit.

Return true. The frog can jump to the last stone by jumping 
1 unit to the 2nd stone, then 2 units to the 3rd stone, then 
2 units to the 4th stone, then 3 units to the 6th stone, 
4 units to the 7th stone, and 5 units to the 8th stone.
Example 2:

[0,1,2,3,4,8,9,11]

Return false. There is no way to jump to the last stone as 
the gap between the 5th and 6th stone is too large.

## Race Car
Your car starts at position 0 and speed +1 on an infinite number line.  (Your car can go into negative positions.)

Your car drives automatically according to a sequence of instructions A (accelerate) and R (reverse).

When you get an instruction "A", your car does the following: position += speed, speed *= 2.

When you get an instruction "R", your car does the following: if your speed is positive then speed = -1 , otherwise speed = 1.  (Your position stays the same.)

For example, after commands "AAR", your car goes to positions 0->1->3->3, and your speed goes to 1->2->4->-1.

Now for some target position, say the length of the shortest sequence of instructions to get there.

Example 1:
Input: 
target = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: 
The shortest instruction sequence is "AA".
Your position goes from 0->1->3.
Example 2:
Input: 
target = 6
Output: 5
Explanation: 
The shortest instruction sequence is "AAARA".
Your position goes from 0->1->3->7->7->6.
 
Note:

1 <= target <= 10000.

## Short Encoding of Words
Given a list of words, we may encode it by writing a reference string S and a list of indexes A.

For example, if the list of words is ["time", "me", "bell"], we can write it as S = "time#bell#" and indexes = [0, 2, 5].

Then for each index, we will recover the word by reading from the reference string from that index until we reach a "#" character.

What is the length of the shortest reference string S possible that encodes the given words?

Example:

Input: words = ["time", "me", "bell"]
Output: 10
Explanation: S = "time#bell#" and indexes = [0, 2, 5].
Note:

1 <= words.length <= 2000.
1 <= words[i].length <= 7.
Each word has only lowercase letters.

## Lemonade Change
At a lemonade stand, each lemonade costs $5. 

Customers are standing in a queue to buy from you, and order one at a time (in the order specified by bills).

Each customer will only buy one lemonade and pay with either a $5, $10, or $20 bill.  You must provide the correct change to each customer, so that the net transaction is that the customer pays $5.

Note that you don't have any change in hand at first.

Return true if and only if you can provide every customer with correct change.

Example 1:

Input: [5,5,5,10,20]
Output: true
Explanation: 
From the first 3 customers, we collect three $5 bills in order.
From the fourth customer, we collect a $10 bill and give back a $5.
From the fifth customer, we give a $10 bill and a $5 bill.
Since all customers got correct change, we output true.
Example 2:

Input: [5,5,10]
Output: true
Example 3:

Input: [10,10]
Output: false
Example 4:

Input: [5,5,10,10,20]
Output: false
Explanation: 
From the first two customers in order, we collect two $5 bills.
For the next two customers in order, we collect a $10 bill and give back a $5 bill.
For the last customer, we can't give change of $15 back because we only have two $10 bills.
Since not every customer received correct change, the answer is false.
 
Note:

0 <= bills.length <= 10000
bills[i] will be either 5, 10, or 20.

## Flipping an Image
Given a binary matrix A, we want to flip the image horizontally, then invert it, and return the resulting image.

To flip an image horizontally means that each row of the image is reversed.  For example, flipping [1, 1, 0] horizontally results in [0, 1, 1].

To invert an image means that each 0 is replaced by 1, and each 1 is replaced by 0. For example, inverting [0, 1, 1] results in [1, 0, 0].

Example 1:

Input: [[1,1,0],[1,0,1],[0,0,0]]
Output: [[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[1,1,1]]
Explanation: First reverse each row: [[0,1,1],[1,0,1],[0,0,0]].
Then, invert the image: [[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[1,1,1]]
Example 2:

Input: [[1,1,0,0],[1,0,0,1],[0,1,1,1],[1,0,1,0]]
Output: [[1,1,0,0],[0,1,1,0],[0,0,0,1],[1,0,1,0]]
Explanation: First reverse each row: [[0,0,1,1],[1,0,0,1],[1,1,1,0],[0,1,0,1]].
Then invert the image: [[1,1,0,0],[0,1,1,0],[0,0,0,1],[1,0,1,0]]
Notes:

1 <= A.length = A[0].length <= 20
0 <= A[i][j] <= 1

## Unique Letter String
A character is unique in string S if it occurs exactly once in it.

For example, in string S = "LETTER", the only unique characters are "L" and "R".

Let's define UNIQ(S) as the number of unique characters in string S.

For example, UNIQ("LETTER") =  2.

Given a string S with only uppercases, calculate the sum of UNIQ(substring) over all non-empty substrings of S.

If there are two or more equal substrings at different positions in S, we consider them different.

Since the answer can be very large, return the answer modulo 10 ^ 9 + 7.

Example 1:

Input: "ABC"
Output: 10
Explanation: All possible substrings are: "A","B","C","AB","BC" and "ABC".
Evey substring is composed with only unique letters.
Sum of lengths of all substring is 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 = 10
Example 2:

Input: "ABA"
Output: 8
Explanation: The same as example 1, except uni("ABA") = 1.
 
Note: 0 <= S.length <= 10000.

## Find and Replace Pattern
You have a list of words and a pattern, and you want to know which words in words matches the pattern.

A word matches the pattern if there exists a permutation of letters p so that after replacing every letter x in the pattern with p(x), we get the desired word.

(Recall that a permutation of letters is a bijection from letters to letters: every letter maps to another letter, and no two letters map to the same letter.)

Return a list of the words in words that match the given pattern. 

You may return the answer in any order.

Example 1:

Input: words = ["abc","deq","mee","aqq","dkd","ccc"], pattern = "abb"
Output: ["mee","aqq"]
Explanation: "mee" matches the pattern because there is a permutation {a -> m, b -> e, ...}. 
"ccc" does not match the pattern because {a -> c, b -> c, ...} is not a permutation,
since a and b map to the same letter.
 
Note:

1 <= words.length <= 50
1 <= pattern.length = words[i].length <= 20

## X of a Kind in a Deck of Cards
In a deck of cards, each card has an integer written on it.

Return true if and only if you can choose X >= 2 such that it is possible to split the entire deck into 1 or more groups of cards, where:

Each group has exactly X cards.
All the cards in each group have the same integer.
 

Example 1:

Input: [1,2,3,4,4,3,2,1]
Output: true
Explanation: Possible partition [1,1],[2,2],[3,3],[4,4]
Example 2:

Input: [1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3]
Output: false
Explanation: No possible partition.
Example 3:

Input: [1]
Output: false
Explanation: No possible partition.
Example 4:

Input: [1,1]
Output: true
Explanation: Possible partition [1,1]
Example 5:

Input: [1,1,2,2,2,2]
Output: true
Explanation: Possible partition [1,1],[2,2],[2,2]

Note:

1 <= deck.length <= 10000
0 <= deck[i] < 10000

## Max Increase to Keep City Skyline
In a 2 dimensional array grid, each value grid[i][j] represents the height of a building located there. We are allowed to increase the height of any number of buildings, by any amount (the amounts can be different for different buildings). Height 0 is considered to be a building as well. 

At the end, the "skyline" when viewed from all four directions of the grid, i.e. top, bottom, left, and right, must be the same as the skyline of the original grid. A city's skyline is the outer contour of the rectangles formed by all the buildings when viewed from a distance. See the following example.

What is the maximum total sum that the height of the buildings can be increased?

Example:
Input: grid = [[3,0,8,4],[2,4,5,7],[9,2,6,3],[0,3,1,0]]
Output: 35
Explanation: 
The grid is:
[ [3, 0, 8, 4], 
  [2, 4, 5, 7],
  [9, 2, 6, 3],
  [0, 3, 1, 0] ]

The skyline viewed from top or bottom is: [9, 4, 8, 7]
The skyline viewed from left or right is: [8, 7, 9, 3]

The grid after increasing the height of buildings without affecting skylines is:

gridNew = [ [8, 4, 8, 7],
            [7, 4, 7, 7],
            [9, 4, 8, 7],
            [3, 3, 3, 3] ]

Notes:

1 < grid.length = grid[0].length <= 50.
All heights grid[i][j] are in the range [0, 100].
All buildings in grid[i][j] occupy the entire grid cell: that is, they are a 1 x 1 x grid[i][j] rectangular prism.

## First Missing Positive
Given an unsorted integer array, find the smallest missing positive integer.

Example 1:

Input: [1,2,0]
Output: 3
Example 2:

Input: [3,4,-1,1]
Output: 2
Example 3:

Input: [7,8,9,11,12]
Output: 1
Note:

Your algorithm should run in O(n) time and uses constant extra space.

## Find All Numbers Disappeared in an Array
Given an array of integers where 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ n (n = size of array), some elements appear twice and others appear once.

Find all the elements of [1, n] inclusive that do not appear in this array.

Could you do it without extra space and in O(n) runtime? You may assume the returned list does not count as extra space.

Example:

Input:
[4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]

Output:
[5,6]

## Reverse Words in a String III
Given a string, you need to reverse the order of characters in each word within a sentence while still preserving whitespace and initial word order.

Example 1:
Input: "Let's take LeetCode contest"
Output: "s'teL ekat edoCteeL tsetnoc"
Note: In the string, each word is separated by single space and there will not be any extra space in the string.

## Shortest Distance to a Character
Given a string S and a character C, return an array of integers representing the shortest distance from the character C in the string.

Example 1:

Input: S = "loveleetcode", C = 'e'
Output: [3, 2, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 1, 0]
 

Note:

S string length is in [1, 10000].
C is a single character, and guaranteed to be in string S.
All letters in S and C are lowercase.

## Groups of Special-Equivalent Strings
You are given an array A of strings.

Two strings S and T are special-equivalent if after any number of moves, S == T.

A move consists of choosing two indices i and j with i % 2 == j % 2, and swapping S[i] with S[j].

Now, a group of special-equivalent strings from A is a non-empty subset S of A such that any string not in S is not special-equivalent with any string in S.

Return the number of groups of special-equivalent strings from A.

 

Example 1:

Input: ["a","b","c","a","c","c"]
Output: 3
Explanation: 3 groups ["a","a"], ["b"], ["c","c","c"]
Example 2:

Input: ["aa","bb","ab","ba"]
Output: 4
Explanation: 4 groups ["aa"], ["bb"], ["ab"], ["ba"]
Example 3:

Input: ["abc","acb","bac","bca","cab","cba"]
Output: 3
Explanation: 3 groups ["abc","cba"], ["acb","bca"], ["bac","cab"]
Example 4:

Input: ["abcd","cdab","adcb","cbad"]
Output: 1
Explanation: 1 group ["abcd","cdab","adcb","cbad"]
 

Note:

1 <= A.length <= 1000
1 <= A[i].length <= 20
All A[i] have the same length.
All A[i] consist of only lowercase letters.

## House Robber
You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security system connected and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.

Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.

Example 1:

Input: [1,2,3,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
             Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
Example 2:

Input: [2,7,9,3,1]
Output: 12
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 2), rob house 3 (money = 9) and rob house 5 (money = 1).
             Total amount you can rob = 2 + 9 + 1 = 12.
             
## Spiral Matrix III
On a 2 dimensional grid with R rows and C columns, we start at (r0, c0) facing east.

Here, the north-west corner of the grid is at the first row and column, and the south-east corner of the grid is at the last row and column.

Now, we walk in a clockwise spiral shape to visit every position in this grid. 

Whenever we would move outside the boundary of the grid, we continue our walk outside the grid (but may return to the grid boundary later.) 

Eventually, we reach all R * C spaces of the grid.

Return a list of coordinates representing the positions of the grid in the order they were visited.

 

Example 1:

Input: R = 1, C = 4, r0 = 0, c0 = 0
Output: [[0,0],[0,1],[0,2],[0,3]]


 

Example 2:

Input: R = 5, C = 6, r0 = 1, c0 = 4
Output: [[1,4],[1,5],[2,5],[2,4],[2,3],[1,3],[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[3,5],[3,4],[3,3],[3,2],[2,2],[1,2],[0,2],[4,5],[4,4],[4,3],[4,2],[4,1],[3,1],[2,1],[1,1],[0,1],[4,0],[3,0],[2,0],[1,0],[0,0]]



Note:

1 <= R <= 100
1 <= C <= 100
0 <= r0 < R
0 <= c0 < C

## Keys and Rooms
There are N rooms and you start in room 0.  Each room has a distinct number in 0, 1, 2, ..., N-1, and each room may have some keys to access the next room. 

Formally, each room i has a list of keys rooms[i], and each key rooms[i][j] is an integer in [0, 1, ..., N-1] where N = rooms.length.  A key rooms[i][j] = v opens the room with number v.

Initially, all the rooms start locked (except for room 0). 

You can walk back and forth between rooms freely.

Return true if and only if you can enter every room.

Example 1:

Input: [[1],[2],[3],[]]
Output: true
Explanation:  
We start in room 0, and pick up key 1.
We then go to room 1, and pick up key 2.
We then go to room 2, and pick up key 3.
We then go to room 3.  Since we were able to go to every room, we return true.
Example 2:

Input: [[1,3],[3,0,1],[2],[0]]
Output: false
Explanation: We can't enter the room with number 2.
Note:

1 <= rooms.length <= 1000
0 <= rooms[i].length <= 1000
The number of keys in all rooms combined is at most 3000.

## Score of Parentheses
Given a balanced parentheses string S, compute the score of the string based on the following rule:

() has score 1
AB has score A + B, where A and B are balanced parentheses strings.
(A) has score 2 * A, where A is a balanced parentheses string.
 

Example 1:

Input: "()"
Output: 1
Example 2:

Input: "(())"
Output: 2
Example 3:

Input: "()()"
Output: 2
Example 4:

Input: "(()(()))"
Output: 6
 

Note:

S is a balanced parentheses string, containing only ( and ).
2 <= S.length <= 50

## Gray Code
The gray code is a binary numeral system where two successive values differ in only one bit.

Given a non-negative integer n representing the total number of bits in the code, print the sequence of gray code. A gray code sequence must begin with 0.

Example 1:

Input: 2
Output: [0,1,3,2]
Explanation:
00 - 0
01 - 1
11 - 3
10 - 2

For a given n, a gray code sequence may not be uniquely defined.
For example, [0,2,3,1] is also a valid gray code sequence.

00 - 0
10 - 2
11 - 3
01 - 1
Example 2:

Input: 0
Output: [0]
Explanation: We define the gray code sequence to begin with 0.
             A gray code sequence of n has size = 2n, which for n = 0 the size is 20 = 1.
             Therefore, for n = 0 the gray code sequence is [0].

## Masking Personal Information
We are given a personal information string S, which may represent either an email address or a phone number.

We would like to mask this personal information according to the following rules:


1. Email address:

We define a name to be a string of length ≥ 2 consisting of only lowercase letters a-z or uppercase letters A-Z.

An email address starts with a name, followed by the symbol '@', followed by a name, followed by the dot '.' and followed by a name. 

All email addresses are guaranteed to be valid and in the format of "name1@name2.name3".

To mask an email, all names must be converted to lowercase and all letters between the first and last letter of the first name must be replaced by 5 asterisks '*'.


2. Phone number:

A phone number is a string consisting of only the digits 0-9 or the characters from the set {'+', '-', '(', ')', ' '}. You may assume a phone number contains 10 to 13 digits.

The last 10 digits make up the local number, while the digits before those make up the country code. Note that the country code is optional. We want to expose only the last 4 digits and mask all other digits.

The local number should be formatted and masked as "***-***-1111", where 1 represents the exposed digits.

To mask a phone number with country code like "+111 111 111 1111", we write it in the form "+***-***-***-1111".  The '+' sign and the first '-' sign before the local number should only exist if there is a country code.  For example, a 12 digit phone number mask should start with "+**-".

Note that extraneous characters like "(", ")", " ", as well as extra dashes or plus signs not part of the above formatting scheme should be removed.

 

Return the correct "mask" of the information provided.

## Reordered Power of 2
Starting with a positive integer N, we reorder the digits in any order (including the original order) such that the leading digit is not zero.

Return true if and only if we can do this in a way such that the resulting number is a power of 2.

Example 1:

Input: 1
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: 10
Output: false
Example 3:

Input: 16
Output: true
Example 4:

Input: 24
Output: false

Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps
Example 2:

Input: 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step

## Add Strings
Given two non-negative integers num1 and num2 represented as string, return the sum of num1 and num2.

Note:

The length of both num1 and num2 is < 5100.
Both num1 and num2 contains only digits 0-9.
Both num1 and num2 does not contain any leading zero.
You must not use any built-in BigInteger library or convert the inputs to integer directly.

## Maximum Length of Pair Chain
You are given n pairs of numbers. In every pair, the first number is always smaller than the second number.

Now, we define a pair (c, d) can follow another pair (a, b) if and only if b < c. Chain of pairs can be formed in this fashion.

Given a set of pairs, find the length longest chain which can be formed. You needn't use up all the given pairs. You can select pairs in any order.

Example 1:
Input: [[1,2], [2,3], [3,4]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The longest chain is [1,2] -> [3,4]
Note:
The number of given pairs will be in the range [1, 1000].

## Majority Element
Given an array of size n, find the majority element. The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊ n/2 ⌋ times.

You may assume that the array is non-empty and the majority element always exist in the array.

Example 1:

Input: [3,2,3]
Output: 3
Example 2:

Input: [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
Output: 2

## Max Consecutive Ones
Given a binary array, find the maximum number of consecutive 1s in this array.

Example 1:
Input: [1,1,0,1,1,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: The first two digits or the last three digits are consecutive 1s.
    The maximum number of consecutive 1s is 3.
Note:

The input array will only contain 0 and 1.
The length of input array is a positive integer and will not exceed 10,000

## Reverse Vowels of a String
Write a function that takes a string as input and reverse only the vowels of a string.

Example 1:
Given s = "hello", return "holle".

Example 2:
Given s = "leetcode", return "leotcede".

Note:
The vowels does not include the letter "y".

## Maximize Distance to Closest Person
In a row of seats, 1 represents a person sitting in that seat, and 0 represents that the seat is empty. 

There is at least one empty seat, and at least one person sitting.

Alex wants to sit in the seat such that the distance between him and the closest person to him is maximized. 

Return that maximum distance to closest person.

Example 1:

Input: [1,0,0,0,1,0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
If Alex sits in the second open seat (seats[2]), then the closest person has distance 2.
If Alex sits in any other open seat, the closest person has distance 1.
Thus, the maximum distance to the closest person is 2.
Example 2:

Input: [1,0,0,0]
Output: 3
Explanation: 
If Alex sits in the last seat, the closest person is 3 seats away.
This is the maximum distance possible, so the answer is 3.
Note:

1 <= seats.length <= 20000
seats contains only 0s or 1s, at least one 0, and at least one 1.

## Relative Ranks
Given scores of N athletes, find their relative ranks and the people with the top three highest scores, who will be awarded medals: "Gold Medal", "Silver Medal" and "Bronze Medal".

Example 1:
Input: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
Output: ["Gold Medal", "Silver Medal", "Bronze Medal", "4", "5"]
Explanation: The first three athletes got the top three highest scores, so they got "Gold Medal", "Silver Medal" and "Bronze Medal". 
For the left two athletes, you just need to output their relative ranks according to their scores.
Note:
N is a positive integer and won't exceed 10,000.
All the scores of athletes are guaranteed to be unique.

## Buddy Strings
Given two strings A and B of lowercase letters, return true if and only if we can swap two letters in A so that the result equals B.

Output: true
Example 2:

Input: A = "ab", B = "ab"
Output: false
Example 3:

Input: A = "aa", B = "aa"
Output: true
Example 4:

Input: A = "aaaaaaabc", B = "aaaaaaacb"
Output: true
Example 5:

Input: A = "", B = "aa"
Output: false
 

Note:

0 <= A.length <= 20000
0 <= B.length <= 20000
A and B consist only of lowercase letters.

## Rotate Image
You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image.

Rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).

Note:

You have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly. DO NOT allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.

Example 1:

Given input matrix = 
[
  [1,2,3],
  [4,5,6],
  [7,8,9]
],

rotate the input matrix in-place such that it becomes:
[
  [7,4,1],
  [8,5,2],
  [9,6,3]
]
Example 2:

Given input matrix =
[
  [ 5, 1, 9,11],
  [ 2, 4, 8,10],
  [13, 3, 6, 7],
  [15,14,12,16]
], 

rotate the input matrix in-place such that it becomes:
[
  [15,13, 2, 5],
  [14, 3, 4, 1],
  [12, 6, 8, 9],
  [16, 7,10,11]
]

## Find All Anagrams in a String
Given a string s and a non-empty string p, find all the start indices of p's anagrams in s.

Strings consists of lowercase English letters only and the length of both strings s and p will not be larger than 20,100.

The order of output does not matter.

Example 1:

Input:
s: "cbaebabacd" p: "abc"

Output:
[0, 6]

Explanation:
The substring with start index = 0 is "cba", which is an anagram of "abc".
The substring with start index = 6 is "bac", which is an anagram of "abc".
Example 2:

Input:
s: "abab" p: "ab"

Output:
[0, 1, 2]

Explanation:
The substring with start index = 0 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
The substring with start index = 1 is "ba", which is an anagram of "ab".
The substring with start index = 2 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".

Output: true
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,0,1,1], k = 1
Output: true
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,1,2,3], k = 2
Output: false

## 2 Keys Keyboard
Initially on a notepad only one character 'A' is present. You can perform two operations on this notepad for each step:

Copy All: You can copy all the characters present on the notepad (partial copy is not allowed).
Paste: You can paste the characters which are copied last time.
Given a number n. You have to get exactly n 'A' on the notepad by performing the minimum number of steps permitted. Output the minimum number of steps to get n 'A'.

Example 1:
Input: 3
Output: 3
Explanation:
Intitally, we have one character 'A'.
In step 1, we use Copy All operation.
In step 2, we use Paste operation to get 'AA'.
In step 3, we use Paste operation to get 'AAA'.
Note:
The n will be in the range [1, 1000].

## Combination Sum III
Find all possible combinations of k numbers that add up to a number n, given that only numbers from 1 to 9 can be used and each combination should be a unique set of numbers.

Note:

All numbers will be positive integers.
The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.
Example 1:

Input: k = 3, n = 7
Output: [[1,2,4]]
Example 2:

Input: k = 3, n = 9
Output: [[1,2,6], [1,3,5], [2,3,4]]

## Escape The Ghosts
You are playing a simplified Pacman game. You start at the point (0, 0), and your destination is (target[0], target[1]). There are several ghosts on the map, the i-th ghost starts at (ghosts[i][0], ghosts[i][1]).

Each turn, you and all ghosts simultaneously *may* move in one of 4 cardinal directions: north, east, west, or south, going from the previous point to a new point 1 unit of distance away.

You escape if and only if you can reach the target before any ghost reaches you (for any given moves the ghosts may take.)  If you reach any square (including the target) at the same time as a ghost, it doesn't count as an escape.

Return True if and only if it is possible to escape.

Example 1:
Input: 
ghosts = [[1, 0], [0, 3]]
target = [0, 1]
Output: true
Explanation: 
You can directly reach the destination (0, 1) at time 1, while the ghosts located at (1, 0) or (0, 3) have no way to catch up with you.
Example 2:
Input: 
ghosts = [[1, 0]]
target = [2, 0]
Output: false
Explanation: 
You need to reach the destination (2, 0), but the ghost at (1, 0) lies between you and the destination.
Example 3:
Input: 
ghosts = [[2, 0]]
target = [1, 0]
Output: false
Explanation: 
The ghost can reach the target at the same time as you.
Note:

All points have coordinates with absolute value <= 10000.
The number of ghosts will not exceed 100.

## Beautiful Arrangement II
Given two integers n and k, you need to construct a list which contains n different positive integers ranging from 1 to n and obeys the following requirement: 
Suppose this list is [a1, a2, a3, ... , an], then the list [|a1 - a2|, |a2 - a3|, |a3 - a4|, ... , |an-1 - an|] has exactly k distinct integers.

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

Example 1:
Input: n = 3, k = 1
Output: [1, 2, 3]
Explanation: The [1, 2, 3] has three different positive integers ranging from 1 to 3, and the [1, 1] has exactly 1 distinct integer: 1.
Example 2:
Input: n = 3, k = 2
Output: [1, 3, 2]
Explanation: The [1, 3, 2] has three different positive integers ranging from 1 to 3, and the [2, 1] has exactly 2 distinct integers: 1 and 2.
Note:
The n and k are in the range 1 <= k < n <= 104.

## Backspace String Compare
Given two strings S and T, return if they are equal when both are typed into empty text editors. # means a backspace character.

Example 1:

Input: S = "ab#c", T = "ad#c"
Output: true
Explanation: Both S and T become "ac".
Example 2:

Input: S = "ab##", T = "c#d#"
Output: true
Explanation: Both S and T become "".
Example 3:

Input: S = "a##c", T = "#a#c"
Output: true
Explanation: Both S and T become "c".
Example 4:

Input: S = "a#c", T = "b"
Output: false
Explanation: S becomes "c" while T becomes "b".
 

Note:

1 <= S.length <= 200
1 <= T.length <= 200
S and T only contain lowercase letters and '#' characters.

## Contains Duplicate
Given an array of integers, find if the array contains any duplicates.

Your function should return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and it should return false if every element is distinct.

Example 1:

Input: [1,2,3,1]
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: [1,2,3,4]
Output: false
Example 3:

Input: [1,1,1,3,3,4,3,2,4,2]
Output: true

## Assign Cookies
Assume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies. But, you should give each child at most one cookie. Each child i has a greed factor gi, which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with; and each cookie j has a size sj. If sj >= gi, we can assign the cookie j to the child i, and the child i will be content. Your goal is to maximize the number of your content children and output the maximum number.

Note:
You may assume the greed factor is always positive. 
You cannot assign more than one cookie to one child.

Example 1:
Input: [1,2,3], [1,1]

Output: 1

Explanation: You have 3 children and 2 cookies. The greed factors of 3 children are 1, 2, 3. 
And even though you have 2 cookies, since their size is both 1, you could only make the child whose greed factor is 1 content.
You need to output 1.
Example 2:
Input: [1,2], [1,2,3]

Output: 2

Explanation: You have 2 children and 3 cookies. The greed factors of 2 children are 1, 2. 
You have 3 cookies and their sizes are big enough to gratify all of the children, 
You need to output 2.

## Goat Latin
A sentence S is given, composed of words separated by spaces. Each word consists of lowercase and uppercase letters only.
We would like to convert the sentence to "Goat Latin" (a made-up language similar to Pig Latin.)
The rules of Goat Latin are as follows:
If a word begins with a vowel (a, e, i, o, or u), append "ma" to the end of the word.
For example, the word 'apple' becomes 'applema'.
If a word begins with a consonant (i.e. not a vowel), remove the first letter and append it to the end, then add "ma".
For example, the word "goat" becomes "oatgma".
Add one letter 'a' to the end of each word per its word index in the sentence, starting with 1.
For example, the first word gets "a" added to the end, the second word gets "aa" added to the end and so on.
Return the final sentence representing the conversion from S to Goat Latin.

Input: matrix = [[1,2],[2,2]]
Output: False
Explanation:
The diagonal "[1, 2]" has different elements.

## Subdomain Visit Count
A website domain like "discuss.leetcode.com" consists of various subdomains. At the top level, we have "com", at the next level, we have "leetcode.com", and at the lowest level, "discuss.leetcode.com". When we visit a domain like "discuss.leetcode.com", we will also visit the parent domains "leetcode.com" and "com" implicitly.

Now, call a "count-paired domain" to be a count (representing the number of visits this domain received), followed by a space, followed by the address. An example of a count-paired domain might be "9001 discuss.leetcode.com".

We are given a list cpdomains of count-paired domains. We would like a list of count-paired domains, (in the same format as the input, and in any order), that explicitly counts the number of visits to each subdomain.

## Island Perimeter
You are given a map in form of a two-dimensional integer grid where 1 represents land and 0 represents water. Grid cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally). The grid is completely surrounded by water, and there is exactly one island (i.e., one or more connected land cells). The island doesn't have "lakes" (water inside that isn't connected to the water around the island). One cell is a square with side length 1. The grid is rectangular, width and height don't exceed 100. Determine the perimeter of the island.

## Fizz Buzz

## Maximum Product of Word Lengths
Given a string array words, find the maximum value of length(word[i]) * length(word[j]) where the two words do not share common letters. You may assume that each word will contain only lower case letters. If no such two words exist, return 0.

Example 1:
Given ["abcw", "baz", "foo", "bar", "xtfn", "abcdef"]
Return 16
The two words can be "abcw", "xtfn".

Example 2:
Given ["a", "ab", "abc", "d", "cd", "bcd", "abcd"]

The number of time points in the given list is at least 2 and won't exceed 20000.
The input time is legal and ranges from 00:00 to 23:59.

## Daily Temperatures
Given a list of daily temperatures, produce a list that, for each day in the input, tells you how many days you would have to wait until a warmer temperature. If there is no future day for which this is possible, put 0 instead.

For example, given the list temperatures = [73, 74, 75, 71, 69, 72, 76, 73], your output should be [1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0].

Note: The length of temperatures will be in the range [1, 30000]. Each temperature will be an integer in the range [30, 100]

## Rabbits in Forest
In a forest, each rabbit has some color. Some subset of rabbits (possibly all of them) tell you how many other rabbits have the same color as them. Those answers are placed in an array.

Return the minimum number of rabbits that could be in the forest.

Examples:
Input: answers = [1, 1, 2]
Output: 5
Explanation:
The two rabbits that answered "1" could both be the same color, say red.
The rabbit than answered "2" can't be red or the answers would be inconsistent.
Say the rabbit that answered "2" was blue.
Then there should be 2 other blue rabbits in the forest that didn't answer into the array.
The smallest possible number of rabbits in the forest is therefore 5: 3 that answered plus 2 that didn't.

Input: answers = [10, 10, 10]
Output: 11

Input: answers = []
Output: 0
Note:

answers will have length at most 1000.
Each answers[i] will be an integer in the range [0, 999].

## Ransom Note
Given an arbitrary ransom note string and another string containing letters from all the magazines, write a function that will return true if the ransom note can be constructed from the magazines ; otherwise, it will return false.

Each letter in the magazine string can only be used once in your ransom note.

Note:
You may assume that both strings contain only lowercase letters.

## Single Number
Given an array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

Note:
Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

## Distribute Candies
Given an integer array with even length, where different numbers in this array represent different kinds of candies. Each number means one candy of the corresponding kind. You need to distribute these candies equally in number to brother and sister. Return the maximum number of kinds of candies the sister could gain.

## Set Mismatch
The set S originally contains numbers from 1 to n. But unfortunately, due to the data error, one of the numbers in the set got duplicated to another number in the set, which results in repetition of one number and loss of another number.

Given an array nums representing the data status of this set after the error. Your task is to firstly find the number occurs twice and then find the number that is missing. Return them in the form of an array.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,2,4]
Output: [2,3]
Note:
The given array size will in the range [2, 10000].
The given array's numbers won't have any order.

## Brick Wall
There is a brick wall in front of you. The wall is rectangular and has several rows of bricks. The bricks have the same height but different width. You want to draw a vertical line from the top to the bottom and cross the least bricks.

The brick wall is represented by a list of rows. Each row is a list of integers representing the width of each brick in this row from left to right.

If your line go through the edge of a brick, then the brick is not considered as crossed. You need to find out how to draw the line to cross the least bricks and return the number of crossed bricks.

You cannot draw a line just along one of the two vertical edges of the wall, in which case the line will obviously cross no bricks.

## Top K Frequent Elements
Given a non-empty array of integers, return the k most frequent elements.

For example,
Given [1,1,1,2,2,3] and k = 2, return [1,2].

Note: 
You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ number of unique elements.
Your algorithm's time complexity must be better than O(n log n), where n is the array's size.

Given a string, your task is to count how many palindromic substrings in this string.

The substrings with different start indexes or end indexes are counted as different substrings even they consist of same characters.

## Max Area of Island
Given a non-empty 2D array grid of 0's and 1's, an island is a group of 1's (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical.) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

Find the maximum area of an island in the given 2D array. (If there is no island, the maximum area is 0.)

## Find the Difference
Given two strings s and t which consist of only lowercase letters.

String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.

Find the letter that was added in t.

## Find Smallest Letter Greater Than Target
Given a list of sorted characters letters containing only lowercase letters, and given a target letter target, find the smallest element in the list that is larger than the given target.

Given four lists A, B, C, D of integer values, compute how many tuples (i, j, k, l) there are such that A[i] + B[j] + C[k] + D[l] is zero.

To make problem a bit easier, all A, B, C, D have same length of N where 0 ≤ N ≤ 500. All integers are in the range of -228 to 228 - 1 and the result is guaranteed to be at most 231 - 1.

## Teemo Attacking
In LOL world, there is a hero called Teemo and his attacking can make his enemy Ashe be in poisoned condition. Now, given the Teemo's attacking ascending time series towards Ashe and the poisoning time duration per Teemo's attacking, you need to output the total time that Ashe is in poisoned condition.

You may assume that Teemo attacks at the very beginning of a specific time point, and makes Ashe be in poisoned condition immediately.

## Baseball Game
You're now a baseball game point recorder.

Given a list of strings, each string can be one of the 4 following types:

Integer (one round's score): Directly represents the number of points you get in this round.
"+" (one round's score): Represents that the points you get in this round are the sum of the last two valid round's points.
"D" (one round's score): Represents that the points you get in this round are the doubled data of the last valid round's points.
"C" (an operation, which isn't a round's score): Represents the last valid round's points you get were invalid and should be removed.
Each round's operation is permanent and could have an impact on the round before and the round after.

You need to return the sum of the points you could get in all the rounds.


## Count and Say

The count-and-say sequence is the sequence of integers beginning as follows:
1, 11, 21, 1211, 111221, ...

1 is read off as "one 1" or 11.
11 is read off as "two 1s" or 21.
21 is read off as "one 2, then one 1" or 1211.
Given an integer n, generate the nth sequence.

Note: The sequence of integers will be represented as a string.


## Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array

Given a sorted array, remove the duplicates in place such that each element appear only once and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this in place with constant memory.

For example,
Given input array nums = [1,1,2],

Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the new length.


## Implement strStr()

Returns the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.


## Move Zeroes

Given an array nums, write a function to move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

For example, given nums = [0, 1, 0, 3, 12], after calling your function, nums should be [1, 3, 12, 0, 0].

Note:
You must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.
Minimize the total number of operations.

## Sum of Two Integers
Calculate the sum of two integers a and b, but you are not allowed to use the operator + and -.

Example:
Given a = 1 and b = 2, return 3.


## First Unique Character in a String
Given a string, find the first non-repeating character in it and return it's index. If it doesn't exist, return -1.

Examples:

s = "leetcode"
return 0

s = "loveleetcode",
return 2.

## Reverse String II
Given a string and an integer k, you need to reverse the first k characters for every 2k characters counting from the start of the string. If there are less than k characters left, reverse all of them. If there are less than 2k but greater than or equal to k characters, then reverse the first k characters and left the other as original.

Example:
Input: s = "abcdefg", k = 2
Output: "bacdfeg"

Restrictions:
The string consists of lower English letters only.
Length of the given string and k will in the range [1, 10000]

##  Base 7
Given an integer, return its base 7 string representation.

Example 1:
Input: 100
Output: "202"
Example 2:
Input: -7
Output: "-10"
Note: The input will be in range of [-1e7, 1e7].


## checkRecord
You are given a string representing an attendance record for a student. The record only contains the following three characters:

'A' : Absent.
'L' : Late.
'P' : Present.
A student could be rewarded if his attendance record doesn't contain more than one 'A' (absent) or more than two continuous 'L' (late).

You need to return whether the student could be rewarded according to his attendance record.


## Ugly Number
Write a program to check whether a given number is an ugly number.

Ugly numbers are positive numbers whose prime factors only include 2, 3, 5. For example, 6, 8 are ugly while 14 is not ugly since it includes another prime factor 7.

Note that 1 is typically treated as an ugly number.


## Perfect Number
We define the Perfect Number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of all its positive divisors except itself.

Now, given an integer n, write a function that returns true when it is a perfect number and false when it is not.
Example:
Input: 28
Output: True
Explanation: 28 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14
Note: The input number n will not exceed 100,000,000. (1e8)

## Length of Last Word
Given a string s consists of upper/lower-case alphabets and empty space characters ' ', return the length of last word in the string.

If the last word does not exist, return 0.

Note: A word is defined as a character sequence consists of non-space characters only.

For example, 
Given s = "Hello World",
return 5.

## Third Maximum Number
Given a non-empty array of integers, return the third maximum number in this array. If it does not exist, return the maximum number. The time complexity must be in O(n).

Example 1:
Input: [3, 2, 1]

Output: 1

Explanation: The third maximum is 1.
Example 2:
Input: [1, 2]

Output: 2

Explanation: The third maximum does not exist, so the maximum (2) is returned instead.
Example 3:
Input: [2, 2, 3, 1]

Output: 1

Explanation: Note that the third maximum here means the third maximum distinct number.
Both numbers with value 2 are both considered as second maximum.


## Count Primes
Description:

Count the number of prime numbers less than a non-negative number, n.

## Reverse Integer
Reverse digits of an integer.

Example1: x = 123, return 321
Example2: x = -123, return -321

click to show spoilers.

Note:
The input is assumed to be a 32-bit signed integer. Your function should return 0 when the reversed integer overflows.

## Single Number III
Given an array of numbers nums, in which exactly two elements appear only once and all the other elements appear exactly twice. Find the two elements that appear only once.

For example:

Given nums = [1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 5], return [3, 5].

Note:
The order of the result is not important. So in the above example, [5, 3] is also correct.
Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it using only constant space complexity?

## Find All Duplicates in an Array
Given an array of integers, 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ n (n = size of array), some elements appear twice and others appear once.

Find all the elements that appear twice in this array.

Could you do it without extra space and in O(n) runtime?

Example:
Input:
[4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]

Output:
[2,3]

## Next Greater Element II
Given a circular array (the next element of the last element is the first element of the array), print the Next Greater Number for every element. The Next Greater Number of a number x is the first greater number to its traversing-order next in the array, which means you could search circularly to find its next greater number. If it doesn't exist, output -1 for this number.

Example 1:
Input: [1,2,1]
Output: [2,-1,2]
Explanation: The first 1's next greater number is 2; 
The number 2 can't find next greater number; 
The second 1's next greater number needs to search circularly, which is also 2.
Note: The length of given array won't exceed 10000.


## Magical String
A magical string S consists of only '1' and '2' and obeys the following rules:

The string S is magical because concatenating the number of contiguous occurrences of characters '1' and '2' generates the string S itself.

The first few elements of string S is the following: S = "1221121221221121122……"

If we group the consecutive '1's and '2's in S, it will be:

1 22 11 2 1 22 1 22 11 2 11 22 ......

and the occurrences of '1's or '2's in each group are:

1 2	2 1 1 2 1 2 2 1 2 2 ......

You can see that the occurrence sequence above is the S itself.

Given an integer N as input, return the number of '1's in the first N number in the magical string S.

Note: N will not exceed 100,000.

Example 1:
Input: 6
Output: 3
Explanation: The first 6 elements of magical string S is "12211" and it contains three 1's, so return 3.

## Single Number II
Given an array of integers, every element appears three times except for one, which appears exactly once. Find that single one.

Note:
Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

## License Key Formatting
Now you are given a string S, which represents a software license key which we would like to format. The string S is composed of alphanumerical characters and dashes. The dashes split the alphanumerical characters within the string into groups. (i.e. if there are M dashes, the string is split into M+1 groups). The dashes in the given string are possibly misplaced.

We want each group of characters to be of length K (except for possibly the first group, which could be shorter, but still must contain at least one character). To satisfy this requirement, we will reinsert dashes. Additionally, all the lower case letters in the string must be converted to upper case.

So, you are given a non-empty string S, representing a license key to format, and an integer K. And you need to return the license key formatted according to the description above.

Example 1:
Input: S = "2-4A0r7-4k", K = 4

Output: "24A0-R74K"

Explanation: The string S has been split into two parts, each part has 4 characters.
Example 2:
Input: S = "2-4A0r7-4k", K = 3

Output: "24-A0R-74K"

Explanation: The string S has been split into three parts, each part has 3 characters except the first part as it could be shorter as said above.
Note:
The length of string S will not exceed 12,000, and K is a positive integer.
String S consists only of alphanumerical characters (a-z and/or A-Z and/or 0-9) and dashes(-).
String S is non-empty.

## Elimination Game

There is a list of sorted integers from 1 to n. Starting from left to right, remove the first number and every other number afterward until you reach the end of the list.

Repeat the previous step again, but this time from right to left, remove the right most number and every other number from the remaining numbers.

We keep repeating the steps again, alternating left to right and right to left, until a single number remains.

Find the last number that remains starting with a list of length n.

Example:

Input:
n = 9,
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
2 4 6 8
2 6
6

Output:
6

## Decode String
Given an encoded string, return it's decoded string.

The encoding rule is: k[encoded_string], where the encoded_string inside the square brackets is being repeated exactly k times. Note that k is guaranteed to be a positive integer.

You may assume that the input string is always valid; No extra white spaces, square brackets are well-formed, etc.

Furthermore, you may assume that the original data does not contain any digits and that digits are only for those repeat numbers, k. For example, there won't be input like 3a or 2[4].

Examples:

s = "3[a]2[bc]", return "aaabcbc".
s = "3[a2[c]]", return "accaccacc".
s = "2[abc]3[cd]ef", return "abcabccdcdcdef".

## Subsets
Given a set of distinct integers, nums, return all possible subsets.

Note: The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets.

For example,
If nums = [1,2,3], a solution is:

[
  [3],
  [1],
  [2],
  [1,2,3],
  [1,3],
  [2,3],
  [1,2],
  []
]

## Spiral Matrix II
Given an integer n, generate a square matrix filled with elements from 1 to n2 in spiral order.

For example,
Given n = 3,

You should return the following matrix:
[
 [ 1, 2, 3 ],
 [ 8, 9, 4 ],
 [ 7, 6, 5 ]
]

##  Integer Break
Given a positive integer n, break it into the sum of at least two positive integers and maximize the product of those integers. Return the maximum product you can get.

For example, given n = 2, return 1 (2 = 1 + 1); given n = 10, return 36 (10 = 3 + 3 + 4).

Note: You may assume that n is not less than 2 and not larger than 58.

## Maximum Product of Three Numbers
Given an integer array, find three numbers whose product is maximum and output the maximum product.

Example 1:
Input: [1,2,3]
Output: 6
Example 2:
Input: [1,2,3,4]
Output: 24
Note:
The length of the given array will be in range [3,104] and all elements are in the range [-1000, 1000].
Multiplication of any three numbers in the input won't exceed the range of 32-bit signed integer.

## Missing Number
Given an array containing n distinct numbers taken from 0, 1, 2, ..., n, find the one that is missing from the array.

For example,
Given nums = [0, 1, 3] return 2.

Note:
Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it using only constant extra space complexity?

## Nim Game
You are playing the following Nim Game with your friend: There is a heap of stones on the table, each time one of you take turns to remove 1 to 3 stones. The one who removes the last stone will be the winner. You will take the first turn to remove the stones.

Both of you are very clever and have optimal strategies for the game. Write a function to determine whether you can win the game given the number of stones in the heap.

For example, if there are 4 stones in the heap, then you will never win the game: no matter 1, 2, or 3 stones you remove, the last stone will always be removed by your friend.

## Reverse String
Write a function that takes a string as input and returns the string reversed.

Example:
Given s = "hello", return "olleh".

## Minimum Moves to Equal Array Elements II
Given a non-empty integer array, find the minimum number of moves required to make all array elements equal, where a move is incrementing a selected element by 1 or decrementing a selected element by 1.

You may assume the array's length is at most 10,000.

Example:

Input:
[1,2,3]

Output:
2

Explanation:
Only two moves are needed (remember each move increments or decrements one element):

[1,2,3]  =>  [2,2,3]  =>  [2,2,2]

## Count Numbers with Unique Digits
Given a non-negative integer n, count all numbers with unique digits, x, where 0 ≤ x < 10n.

Example:
Given n = 2, return 91. (The answer should be the total numbers in the range of 0 ≤ x < 100, excluding [11,22,33,44,55,66,77,88,99])

## Sort Characters By Frequency
Given a string, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of characters.

Example 1:

Input:
"tree"

Output:
"eert"

Explanation:
'e' appears twice while 'r' and 't' both appear once.
So 'e' must appear before both 'r' and 't'. Therefore "eetr" is also a valid answer.
Example 2:

Input:
"cccaaa"

Output:
"cccaaa"

Explanation:
Both 'c' and 'a' appear three times, so "aaaccc" is also a valid answer.
Note that "cacaca" is incorrect, as the same characters must be together.
Example 3:

Input:
"Aabb"

Output:
"bbAa"

Explanation:
"bbaA" is also a valid answer, but "Aabb" is incorrect.
Note that 'A' and 'a' are treated as two different characters.


## Single Element in a Sorted Array
Given a sorted array consisting of only integers where every element appears twice except for one element which appears once. Find this single element that appears only once.

Example 1:
Input: [1,1,2,3,3,4,4,8,8]
Output: 2
Example 2:
Input: [3,3,7,7,10,11,11]
Output: 10
Note: Your solution should run in O(log n) time and O(1) space.

## Zuma Game
Think about Zuma Game. You have a row of balls on the table, colored red(R), yellow(Y), blue(B), green(G), and white(W). You also have several balls in your hand.

Each time, you may choose a ball in your hand, and insert it into the row (including the leftmost place and rightmost place). Then, if there is a group of 3 or more balls in the same color touching, remove these balls. Keep doing this until no more balls can be removed.

Find the minimal balls you have to insert to remove all the balls on the table. If you cannot remove all the balls, output -1.

Examples:

Input: "WRRBBW", "RB"
Output: -1
Explanation: WRRBBW -> WRR[R]BBW -> WBBW -> WBB[B]W -> WW

Input: "WWRRBBWW", "WRBRW"
Output: 2
Explanation: WWRRBBWW -> WWRR[R]BBWW -> WWBBWW -> WWBB[B]WW -> WWWW -> empty

Input:"G", "GGGGG"
Output: 2
Explanation: G -> G[G] -> GG[G] -> empty 

Input: "RBYYBBRRB", "YRBGB"
Output: 3
Explanation: RBYYBBRRB -> RBYY[Y]BBRRB -> RBBBRRB -> RRRB -> B -> B[B] -> BB[B] -> empty 

Note:
You may assume that the initial row of balls on the table won’t have any 3 or more consecutive balls with the same color.
The number of balls on the table won't exceed 20, and the string represents these balls is called "board" in the input.
The number of balls in your hand won't exceed 5, and the string represents these balls is called "hand" in the input.
Both input strings will be non-empty and only contain characters 'R','Y','B','G','W'.

## Happy Number
Write an algorithm to determine if a number is "happy".

A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.

Example: 19 is a happy number

12 + 92 = 82
82 + 22 = 68
62 + 82 = 100
12 + 02 + 02 = 1

## Remove Element
Given an array and a value, remove all instances of that value in place and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this in place with constant memory.

The order of elements can be changed. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the new length.

Example:
Given input array nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3

Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2.

## Pascal's Triangle
Given numRows, generate the first numRows of Pascal's triangle.

For example, given numRows = 5,
Return

[
     [1],
    [1,1],
   [1,2,1],
  [1,3,3,1],
 [1,4,6,4,1]
]

## Pascal's Triangle II
Given an index k, return the kth row of the Pascal's triangle.

For example, given k = 3,
Return [1,3,3,1].

Note:
Could you optimize your algorithm to use only O(k) extra space?

## Arranging Coins
You have a total of n coins that you want to form in a staircase shape, where every k-th row must have exactly k coins.

Given n, find the total number of full staircase rows that can be formed.

n is a non-negative integer and fits within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.

Example 1:

n = 5

The coins can form the following rows:
¤
¤ ¤
¤ ¤

Because the 3rd row is incomplete, we return 2.
Example 2:

n = 8

The coins can form the following rows:
¤
¤ ¤
¤ ¤ ¤
¤ ¤

Because the 4th row is incomplete, we return 3.

## Number of Segments in a String
Count the number of segments in a string, where a segment is defined to be a contiguous sequence of non-space characters.

Please note that the string does not contain any non-printable characters.

Example:

Input: "Hello, my name is John"
Output: 5
